# RF-SNN Classifier

A spiking neural network (SNN) that classifies RF signal modulation types (e.g., AM, FM, BPSK) using NengoDL.  
This project explores low-power, brain-inspired signal processing for real-time inference in neuromorphic systems.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Traditional modulation classifiers (e.g., CNNs) are computationally expensive and poorly suited for edge deployment.  
This project implements a biologically inspired approach using spiking neural networks, aiming for:

- Real-time classification of modulated RF signals
- Energy-efficient inference with sparse spiking activity
- Compatibility with neuromorphic hardware (e.g., Loihi, FPGA, ODIN)

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Input**: RF signal samples or engineered features (rate-coded)
- **Ensemble A**: 128 LIF neurons (projects from input)
- **Ensemble B** (optional): 128 LIF neurons, adds depth
- **Output**: 3-node classification layer for AM/FM/BPSK
- **Training**: Supervised learning via surrogate gradients (NengoDL)

The architecture mimics biological signal flow with discrete spiking events, enabling eventual deployment to neuromorphic hardware.
